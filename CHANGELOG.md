# Changelog

## v0.5.0 - 2024-08-22

### Bug Fixes

* fix: nested category docs (BREAKING CHANGE) @joshbeard (#88)
  * Previously, category docs that were nested under a parent document were not
    returned in the response. This has been fixed.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: The response structure for the `category.GetDocs()` method
    has changed. The `CategoryDocsChildren` struct has been removed and the
    existing `CategoryDocs` struct is now used for the nested category docs.
    The existing `Children` field is present for nested docs, but ReadMe limits
    the depth of the nested docs to 1 level. (Category -> Parent Doc -> Child)
  
* fix: pagination results are incomplete
  * #84 broke pagination because it didn't properly append the results to the
    response. This has been fixed.
